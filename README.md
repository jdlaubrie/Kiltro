# Kiltro
Finite Elements project. By now the solver is able to work with uni-dimensional
and bi-dimensional heat-transfer problems, in steady and transient scenario. The 
code assembles the linear system resulting from the convection-diffusion equation.

## Prerequisites
- NumPy

## Soon
- _Robin boundary conditions, Newton cooling_
- _Integration of characteristic-Galerking within the transient solver_
